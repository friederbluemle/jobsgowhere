- [#3](https://github.com/jobsgowhere/jobsgowhere/issues/3): Create contribution guidelines (@subhransu can work on it)
- [#4](https://github.com/jobsgowhere/jobsgowhere/issues/4): Figure out the frontend architecture
  - Find out whether you want to use React / Next.js or both with golang backend (@lxcid and @SheldonCheng to discuss)
    - @SheldonCheng: for integration with golang, it shoudln't be too different from react i think.
      it can be built into static html and served, just that initial api calls and page rendering happens on server
      don't think we will have a lot of static pages so perhaps no great advantage to using nextjs here (other than SEO maybe). So prob can just use standard react
  - TypeScript or JavaScript
    - TypeScript, learning experience for implementors
- [#5](https://github.com/jobsgowhere/jobsgowhere/issues/5): Come up with 1st draft of the UI (@sheldon and Yao Long can work together on this)
- Initial JSON structure (@subhransu and @lxcid)
